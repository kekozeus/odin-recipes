    <h1>How to make Deviled Eggs</h1>
    <img src="../images/eggs.jpg"><br>
    <p>These deviled eggs are delicious for Easter brunch and are always popular at our holiday parties. Adjust the amount of salt and sugar in this recipe to suit your taste. I like to add onion and celery for a little more texture.</p> <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> This recipe yields 12 deviled egg halves, so you’ll need six boiled eggs. </li>
        <li><strong>Mayonnaise: </strong>Mayonnaise makes the filling extra creamy. </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>A teaspoon of white sugar lends a hint of sweetness. </li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar: </strong>A teaspoon of white vinegar, meanwhile, cuts the sweetness with acidity. </li>
        <li><strong>Mustard: </strong>Use store-bought prepared mustard or homemade yellow mustard. </li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>You’ll need an onion and celery. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>These deviled eggs are seasoned with salt and paprika. </li>
    </ul><br>
